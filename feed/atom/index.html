Thanks to the generosity of the New Jersey Nets, we attended the Cavaliers-Nets game in East Rutherford, New Jersey on Wednesday, March 12, 2008 at 7:30 PM. About ten minutes before tip-off, the Nets honored Seth by naming him the “Hometown Hero” of the month.</p>
<p>The Nets advertised our website at the game, and donated a portion of the night’s group ticket sales to The 243 Foundation. With LeBron James in the house, and a sold-out crowd, there were 20,000 people who were able to see what Seth means to us all.</p>
<p>A generous portion of every group ticket purchased for the night’s game was donated to The 243 Foundation.  There are no words to describe how much The New Jersey Nets have already done for Seth and for The 243 Foundation. We thank them from the deepest reaches of our hearts.</p>
